#### Target paper
target paper title:ResearchAgent: Iterative Research Idea Generation over Scientific Literature with Large Language Models
target paper abstract:Scientific Research, vital for improving human life, is hindered by its inherent complexity, slow pace, and the need for specialized experts. To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.
#### Initial proposal
Cross-Modal Associative Research Ideation:
Type: algorithm design
Problem: Current large language models (LLMs) like the ResearchAgent excel at generating research ideas from textual data but struggle to incorporate multi-modal inputs effectively, limiting the diversity and creativity of generated ideas.
Existing Methods: The ResearchAgent uses LLMs to generate research ideas iteratively, leveraging academic graphs and entity-centric knowledge stores to refine ideas. However, it primarily focuses on text-based inputs and lacks the integration of multi-modal data to enhance creativity.
Motivation: Inspired by the cognitive basis of creativity, where multi-modal cues can trigger novel connections, we propose integrating associative thinking strategies with multi-modal inputs to enhance the creativity and diversity of research ideas. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of multi-modal AI models to generate more innovative and diverse research ideas.
Proposed Method: We propose a novel framework called Cross-Modal Associative Research Ideation (CMARI). The CMARI framework consists of three main components: (1) Multi-Modal Data Integration: Collect and preprocess data across visual, auditory, and textual modalities from scientific literature, including figures, audio recordings, and textual descriptions. (2) Associative Thinking Algorithm: Develop an algorithm that links disparate concepts across modalities, inspired by cognitive science principles. This algorithm will use cross-modal embeddings to identify and connect related concepts, fostering creative idea generation. (3) Iterative Refinement: Implement an iterative process where the generated ideas are refined through feedback loops with ReviewingAgents, incorporating multi-modal insights to enhance creativity and diversity.
Experiment Plan: To evaluate CMARI, we will conduct experiments on a diverse set of scientific publications across multiple disciplines. Baselines will include the original ResearchAgent and other text-based ideation models. Evaluation metrics will focus on creativity, diversity, and novelty of generated ideas, using both human and model-based assessments. We will also explore the impact of different modalities on idea generation and assess the computational efficiency of the proposed framework.

### Output
#### Thinking:
To ensure this project has the potential to win best paper awards at top conferences like ACL, NeurIPS, ICLR, or CVPR, several aspects of the initial idea and the `method_decom_info` have been refined and emphasized:

1.  **Strengthened Novelty and Significance:** While the base idea of multi-modal input is good, the proposal now emphasizes the *Cross-Modal Associative Thinking Algorithm* as the core innovation. This isn't just about feeding multi-modal data but about an explicit algorithm, inspired by cognitive science, to find *non-obvious, creative links* between modalities. This goes beyond simple multi-modal fusion and tackles a harder problem in AI creativity. The significance is amplified by framing it as a way to unlock a new level of AI-assisted scientific discovery.

2.  **Enhanced Methodological Detail and Rigor:** The three modules from `method_decom_info` are adopted and significantly detailed.
    *   **Multi-Modal Data Integration:** Specifics on data sources, extraction techniques (mentioning tools like `pdffigures2`, `nougat`, `Whisper`), and preprocessing steps are included. The "Data Storage Architecture" is considered.
    *   **Associative Thinking Algorithm:** This is the heart. The proposal details how cross-modal embeddings (e.g., CLIP, sentence-transformers) will be used, how concepts will be identified, and crucially, how "associative links" or "chains" will be formed (e.g., Text Concept -> Visual Feature -> Related Text Concept in another paper). This algorithmic component is key for distinguishing the work.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** The proposal explicitly integrates this with multi-modal feedback, making the ReviewingAgents more powerful by allowing them to critique based on multi-modal evidence and how well the idea leverages cross-modal insights.

3.  **Robust and Comprehensive Experiment Plan:**
    *   **Clear Baselines:** Includes the target paper (ResearchAgent) and simpler LLM prompting.
    *   **Detailed Metrics:** Combines human evaluation (crucial for creativity, novelty) with model-based proxies and quantitative diversity measures. Specific criteria for human evaluation are outlined, including a CMARI-specific metric on cross-modal integration.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** Planned to demonstrate the contribution of each modality and the associative linking mechanism.
    *   **Concrete Prompting Examples:** Provided for both idea generation and reviewer agent interaction, showing how multi-modal insights are explicitly incorporated into the prompts. This makes the "how-to" much clearer.
    *   **Feasibility with Black-Box LLMs:** The plan ensures that operations like embedding generation, image captioning, and LLM interactions can be done via APIs (e.g., OpenAI) or with open-source models, respecting typical research constraints.

4.  **Connection to Cognitive Science:** The motivation from cognitive theories of associative thinking is made more explicit and woven into the algorithm design, adding depth and interdisciplinary appeal.

5.  **Targeting Award-Winning Qualities:**
    *   **Impact:** Addresses a fundamental challenge in research – ideation – with a potentially transformative approach.
    *   **Innovation:** The core associative algorithm and its application to research ideation are innovative.
    *   **Soundness:** The methodology is broken down into feasible, well-defined steps.
    *   **Evaluation:** The multi-faceted evaluation plan aims for convincing evidence.

The `MethodSubmodulesJsonList` was a good starting point. Its strengths were the clear modularization and the thinking behind each module. The expansion focused on:
*   Making the "Associative Thinking Algorithm" more concrete and algorithmic, rather than just a general idea.
*   Detailing *how* multi-modal data translates into better ideas through specific prompting strategies and feedback mechanisms.
*   Designing experiments that can rigorously test the central hypotheses and isolate the contributions of the novel components.

By focusing on these aspects, the proposal moves from a good idea to a plan for a potentially high-impact research paper.

    "Title": "CMARI: Fostering Creative Research Ideation via Cross-Modal Associative Learning and Multi-Modal Inputs",
    "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs), including advanced systems like ResearchAgent, primarily leverage textual data for generating research ideas. This uni-modal focus inherently limits the diversity, novelty, and creative potential of the generated ideas, as human scientific creativity often arises from synthesizing information across multiple modalities (e.g., textual descriptions, visual diagrams, auditory discussions). The problem is significant because the pace of scientific discovery is often bottlenecked by the ability to formulate truly innovative research questions and hypotheses. Overcoming the uni-modal limitation in AI-driven ideation can unlock new perspectives and accelerate scientific breakthroughs.",
    "Motivation": "The target paper, 'ResearchAgent: Iterative Research Idea Generation over Scientific Literature with Large Language Models,' demonstrates the power of LLMs in iteratively generating and refining research ideas using textual academic graphs and entity-centric knowledge stores. However, its reliance on text-only inputs means it cannot fully tap into the rich semantic information embedded in figures, tables, and potentially audio-visual materials associated with scientific literature. Classical ideation methods are often manual and time-consuming. While recent LLM-based methods like ResearchAgent automate parts of this, they inherit the uni-modal constraint.\nOur motivation for CMARI (Cross-Modal Associative Research Ideation) stems from two key insights: \n1. Cognitive Basis of Creativity: Human creativity often involves 'associative thinking' – connecting seemingly disparate concepts. These connections can be triggered by multi-modal cues (e.g., an image sparking an analogy, a spoken phrase linking to a textual concept). \n2. Advances in Multi-Modal AI: Models like CLIP, ImageBind, and VLMs (Vision-Language Models) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and relating information across different modalities. \nCMARI is proposed to work better than existing text-only baselines (like the original ResearchAgent) because it explicitly integrates multi-modal data (visual, auditory, textual) and employs a novel associative thinking algorithm to discover non-obvious links between concepts across these modalities. These cross-modal associations can serve as powerful 'creative sparks' or 'conceptual bridges' that text-only systems would miss, leading to a richer and more diverse set of initial hypotheses. The subsequent iterative refinement, now informed by multi-modal feedback, can further enhance the quality and grounding of these novel ideas.",
