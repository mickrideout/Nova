### Output
Thinking:
The goal is to develop a search plan to gather information for enhancing the "ResearchAgent" paper, which currently uses linguistic inputs for research idea generation. The enhancement involves incorporating multi-modal inputs (visual and textual data) to improve the creativity and diversity of generated research ideas.

The search plan needs to be structured to cover:
1.  Understanding the baseline capabilities and architecture of the target paper ("ResearchAgent") or similar text-based idea generation systems.
2.  Exploring the foundational AI technologies required for multi-modal processing (i.e., models that can handle both visual and textual data).
3.  Investigating the theoretical basis for how visual information can enhance creativity and ideation.
4.  Researching specific techniques for integrating and fusing multi-modal data within generative models, particularly for tasks like idea generation.
5.  Finding examples or methods for applying multi-modal AI specifically within the scientific domain, considering the types of visual data available (e.g., figures from papers, experimental results).
6.  Determining how to evaluate the impact of multi-modal inputs on the creativity and diversity of the generated ideas.
7.  Identifying potential challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations of using multi-modal AI for research idea generation.

This structured approach will ensure comprehensive information gathering, supporting the development of a more creative and diverse "ResearchAgent" by leveraging multi-modal inputs. Each step in the plan aims to contribute knowledge directly applicable to modifying and improving the target paper's methodology.
